Dockerize BOTH apps - the Python and the Node app.

1) Create appropriate images for both apps (two separate images!).
HINT: Have a brief look at the app code to configure your images correctly!

docker build -t node_app_assignment_i:v1 .

docker build -t python_app_assignment_i:v1 .

2) Launch a container for each created image, making sure, 
that the app inside the container works correctly and is usable.

docker run -p 3000:3000 node_app_assignment_i:v1

docker run -it python_app_assignment_i:v1

3) Re-create both containers and assign names to both containers.
Use these names to stop and restart both containers.

docker run -p 3000:3000 --name node_app_assignment_c node_app_assignment_i:v1

docker run -it --name python_app_assignment_c python_app_assignment_i:v1

4) Clean up (remove) all stopped (and running) containers, 
clean up all created images.

5) Re-build the images - this time with names and tags assigned to them.

6) Run new containers based on the re-built images, ensuring that the containers
are removed automatically when stopped.
